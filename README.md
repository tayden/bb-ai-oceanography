This repo contains the code for generating clusters and labels for papers relating to ML use in Oceanography.

The code is adapted from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lmcinnes/7a39a9f103f25300aee07201bb0a9b8a) by Leland McInnes at the Tutte Institute, and replicates his work showing clusters in ML papers published on ArXiv.
